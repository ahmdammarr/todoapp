Graphql server endpoint is provided in .env.example



#### Please note that the remote server is using a cached database so any data in the server will not be persisted permanently, I've published it for the purpose of Graphql implementation.

#### Also i hosted  the server in Heroku free hosting plan so it might take a while in the first load because Heroku dynos will be in sleep state if not used for a while
